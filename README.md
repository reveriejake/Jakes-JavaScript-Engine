# Jakes-JavaScript-Engine
JavaScript Engine Project

This project is a portfolio collaboration with a few artist friends. The idea is to quickly ramp up my skills in JavaScript by creating a 2D game engine from scratch without third-party libraries. This project makes use of the 2D context however once our initial game is released, I would like to use my knowledge of OpenGL to explore 3D using the WebGL context.

Stay tuned for further updates!
